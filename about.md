Every day 2.5 [Exabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte) data are produced (which is equivalent to 530 000 000 millions songs) and this number will increase in next years! Data comes from everywhere: social networks, medical records, commercial transactions, mobile phones, weather sensors, etc. Most of them are [unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data) and device-generated. We are living in a **big data** world. We are living in a **crazy data** world! Big data is the new black gold and a certain expertise is required to extract valuable knowledge and to maximize its utility: **Data Science**.

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves mathematics, statistics, information science and computer science. The job title **Data Scientist** becomes popular when in 2012 Harvard Business Review called it "**The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century**". However, it is hard to find a person who is an expert in every aspect of data science: business translation, data collection, big data infrastructure, software engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, time series forecasting, data visualization, etc. Furthermore, despite the general enthusiasm for big data, data science is not the answer to every question of this world! I strongly believe that in order to achieve success in a data project we need to:

* understand the business problem;
* formulate the right question;
* understand the data and collect the useful one;
* evaluate the models critically;
* recognize that we cannot always find a solution.

Hi! My name is Shuyi and I am a wannabe **data scientist**, always curious and eager to learn. I live in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin) (a wonderful Italian city) and I currently work at the **Big Data Lab** of [Intesa Sanpaolo](http://www.group.intesasanpaolo.com/scriptIsir0/si09/eng_index.jsp), one of the largest banking groups in Italy. I had former work experiences as **research assistant** (at [IGIER](http://www.igier.unibocconi.it/), Bocconi University) and as **teacher** of training courses for Italian Mathematics Olympiads (at [Associazione Subalpina Mathesis](http://www.mathesistorino.it/)). Regarding my education background, I completed my **Master's Degree in Mathematics** at [University of Turin](http://matematicalm.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) in 2016, and in the same year I was awarded the **Master in Economics** by [Collegio Carlo Alberto](http://www.carloalberto.org/) for the [Allievi Honors Program](http://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi/).

On [**CrazyData.Science**](https://crazydata.science/) I aim to add interesting contents on data science: tutorials, machine learning algorithms, R or Python libraries, statistical analysis, software reviews and so on. Articles are published as soon as they are ready, hence,  there is no regularity in the release of new contents. Hope you find [**Crazy Data Science**](https://crazydata.science/) useful! Of course, write me for any comments or corrections!
